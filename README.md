# Final Lab Work for Evaluation
**Lab 02 to 05**.  Lab 02 to 05 are uploaded in separate repositories as their Github link was required to be uploaded at the end of each Lab's associated quiz. In the given folders their Github repositories links are given.
**Lab 01 & Lab 06 to 10**. Lab 01 and Lab 06 to Lab 10 are uploaded in respective folders. 
The lab 01, and 06 to 10 files, present outside the folders, are the same but having a Colab link also if the assesor wants to run the codes. 
In the folders the same files are uploaded but without the Colab link. Smehow, I could not get the Colab link on those files after uploading them directly from my Laptop drive.
